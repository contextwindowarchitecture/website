"""Builds conformance/rejections/: snapshots that break exactly one of conformance/README.md's Snapshot checks
or their schemas. A conformant assembler rejects each before assembly, with no payload and no trace (R-17).

Each case changes fixture-three-slot's snapshot in one place, or messages-render's for the cwa-messages/v1
rules. The website's tests check each with contract.js's checkSnapshot, which must find exactly one
problem, independently of this generator.
