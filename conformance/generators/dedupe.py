"""Builds the deduplication conformance cases (R-24) from tables of intended outcomes.

Each case lists its candidates, the conflict groups it declares, and "duplicates": each item it
intends deduplication to exclude, with the item kept in its place. conflicts.py builds the snapshot,
trace and payload, and checks the table against conformance/README.md's Deduplication section.
